(ns noise.vectors-test
  "The official Noise known-answer vectors, run end to end.

  This is the test that decides whether this library is a Noise implementation or
  merely a program that does Noise-shaped things. Every static AND ephemeral key
  is fixed by the vector, so the handshake is fully deterministic: if a single
  token were mis-ordered, one DH mixed with the wrong key, or `h` mixed with a
  plaintext where the spec says ciphertext, the very first ciphertext would
  differ from what the reference implementations produce.

  Coverage: IK (the pattern the overlay uses), XX (bootstrap without a known
  remote static) and NN (anonymous), each under both
  `25519_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2s` and `25519_ChaChaPoly_SHA256` — 6 vectors,
  6 handshake messages each including the post-handshake transport messages."
