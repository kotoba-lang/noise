  "BLAKE2s and HMAC-BLAKE2s against known answers.

  Two independent sources, deliberately:

  1. **RFC 7693 appendix A** — the spec's own `BLAKE2s-256(\"abc\")` vector.
  2. **OpenSSL** (via Node's `crypto.createHash('blake2s256')` /
     `createHmac('blake2s256', …)`) for the cases the RFC does not tabulate:
     the empty input, the block boundary (63/64/65 bytes — where an off-by-one in
     the final-block flag hides), multi-block inputs, and HMAC with both a short
     key and a full 32-byte key.

  The block-boundary cases are the point. A BLAKE2 implementation that only ever
  hashes short inputs will pass a single vector while getting `t` (the byte
  counter) or the final-block flag wrong for anything ≥ 64 bytes — and Noise's
  own inputs are short, so the bug would not surface until this library hashed
  something larger."
