  "The transport phase: what happens after the handshake, for the next few
  hundred million packets. Pure — the caller owns the clock and the socket.

  Noise itself says almost nothing about this: it hands you two CipherStates and
  assumes an in-order, reliable, lossless stream. A datagram overlay has none of
  those, so this namespace adds the three things WireGuard adds, and no more:

  1. **An explicit counter on the wire.** Each transport frame is
     `[counter:8 little-endian][ciphertext]`. Without it, one dropped UDP packet
     desynchronizes the nonces and every subsequent packet fails to
     authenticate.
  2. **A replay window.** A counter that was already accepted, or that is older
     than the window, is rejected. Accepting a replay of an authenticated packet
     is still an attack even though the attacker cannot forge new content.
  3. **Rekey and expiry policy on time and volume**, so a session's keys have a
     bounded lifetime and a bounded amount of traffic under them.

  We do NOT claim WireGuard wire compatibility: the handshake framing, the
  cookie/DoS-mitigation messages and the exact 4-byte type/index header are
  WireGuard's, and this is a different overlay whose identities come from the
  kekkai netmap. What is shared is the cryptographic design (Noise IK, X25519,
  ChaCha20-Poly1305) and the session semantics in this file."
